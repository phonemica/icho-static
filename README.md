# Ichō mobile

This is the repository for the offline version of the Ichō mobile phone dictionary. It is part of the larger Ichō dictionary project, an effort to provide easy to use tools to manage community-driven development and curation of dictionaries for under-documented language varieties.

The software is provided as-is. Unfortunately due to a lack of resources we are not able to provide much support. All code is provided in this repository, and improvements are welcome.
